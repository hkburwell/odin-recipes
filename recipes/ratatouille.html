    <p>
      Ratatouille is a French Provençal dish of stewed vegetables which
      originated in Nice, and is sometimes referred to as ratatouille niçoise
      (French: [niswaz]).[1] Recipes and cooking times differ widely, but common
      ingredients include tomato, garlic, onion, courgette (zucchini), aubergine
      (eggplant), capsicum (bell pepper), and some combination of leafy green
      herbs common to the region.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2 tablespoons olive oil, divided</li>

      <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>

      <li>1 eggplant, cut into 1/2 inch cubes</li>

      <li>2 teaspoons dried parsley</li>

      <li>salt to taste</li>

      <li>1 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>

      <li>2 zucchini, sliced</li>

      <li>2 large tomatoes, chopped</li>

      <li>2 cups sliced fresh mushrooms</li>

      <li>1 large onion, sliced into rings</li>

      <li>1 green bell pepper, sliced</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Coat the bottom and
        sides of a 1 1/2-quart casserole dish with 1 tablespoon olive oil.
      </li>

      <li>
        Heat remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil in a medium skillet over medium
        heat. Cook and stir garlic until fragrant and golden brown. Add eggplant
        and parsley; cook and stir until eggplant is tender and soft, about 10
        minutes. Season with salt to taste.
      </li>

      <li>
        Spread eggplant mixture evenly across the bottom of the prepared
        casserole dish; sprinkle with a few tablespoons of Parmesan cheese.
        Spread zucchini in an even layer over top. Lightly salt and sprinkle
        with a little more cheese. Continue layering in this fashion, with
        tomatoes, mushrooms, onion, and bell pepper, covering each layer with a
        sprinkling of salt and cheese.
      </li>
      <li>Bake in preheated oven until vegetables are tender, 45 minutes.</li>
